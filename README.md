# Introduction
This page acts as a composite of personal data science projects I've worked on. Projects are split into two categories:

1. Major Projects
2. Minor Projects

A *major project* is any project that I consider applicable to a 'real world' scenario, requires some to many high level techniques to adequately solve, or involves a considerable variety of low-level methods to solve. *Minor projects* are ones of trivial 'real world' importance or arbitrary data, only necessitates a naive approach, or holds code to generate certain statistical methods (e.g.: My code for bootstrapping). Major projects will be detailed in lower sections, and likely have corresponding reports. Minor reports are posted in this repository with brief comment at the top of the code.

Code is broken into five categories:

#### 1. Complete (C)
Necessitate no more changes and work as run on test cases. 

#### 2. Near-Complete (NC)
Run on intended test cases, have advanced or complete functionality. Usually pending cleanup, fringe testing, or a small feature I wanted to include to elevate the project a little more. 

#### 3. Work-In-Progress (WIP)
Self explanatory. Semi-functional and major work still being conducted. 

#### 4. Postponed (P)
A project I whiffed on or am otherwise stuck. Suspected issues and future plans will be detailed in header.
